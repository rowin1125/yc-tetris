## Why a Tetris

This projects was the result of having a nice talk with a colleage of my. "If it was possible to create Tetris in react with all te game logic".... DUHHH. I started doing lots of research about how others implemented Tetris with normal Javascript and from there I created the gamelogic for Tetris.

## usp:

- Game is pure React
- Game logic with Hooks
- Works very well if i say so myself
- Realtime database with Firebase
- Included all the rules of Tetris
- Solution for mobile

## learnings:

- A lot of problem solving
- How to optimze the application
- How to intergrate the realtime database
- Convert all the rules of Teris to code (OMG)
